        <h1>Cheezy Pizza Cafe - WordPress Website Reflection</h1>
        <p>This is my WordPress website: <a href="https://cheezypizzacafe.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Cheezy Pizza Cafe</a></p>

        <h2>Research and Design</h2>
        <p>I looked at the websites of three pizza places in Arlington:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.pupatella.com" target="_blank">Pupatella</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.pie-tanza.com" target="_blank">Pie-tanza</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.wethepizza.com" target="_blank">We The Pizza</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of these websites had their menus or a sample of their menus right on the homepage, so I did the same for my website. I also saw how they used pictures of their food to make their websites look good, so I added photos of good-looking pizzas on the home page. All the websites listed the ingredients for their food, so I did the same for my website.</p>
    
    
    
        <h2>My Experience with WordPress</h2>
        <p>My experience with WordPress was mixed. I liked that you can choose your theme, and the free ones looked as good as the paid ones. But after that, I was overwhelmed with all the options and menus. I didn't know how to add pages or make the links work, and it took some time. But after using it and getting some practice, it became super easy to customize. I also liked how easy it was to just drag and drop text or images to the pages.</p>
