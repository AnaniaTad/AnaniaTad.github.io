####  My journey with learning terminal

- Terminal gives you direct control over your computer through commands

- Git tracks code changes 

- Vim is text editor within the terminal

- Markdown is for formatting text 

It was hard at first but after practicing i feel a lot better using these tools 

## Tips for new students 

- Focus on one tool at a time.

- Repetition is key especially with Git and Vim

- And Practice Daily
