# Cheezy Pizza Cafe - WordPress Website Reflection

This is my WordPress website: [Cheezy Pizza Cafe](https://cheezypizzacafe.wordpress.com/).

I looked at the websites of three pizza places in Arlington: [Pupatella](https://www.pupatella.com), [Pie-tanza](https://www.pie-tanza.com), and [We The Pizza](https://www.wethepizza.com). All of these websites had their menus or a sample of their menus right on the homepage, so I did the same for my website. I also saw how they used pictures of their food to make their websites look good, so I added photos of good-looking pizzas on the home page. All the websites listed the ingredients for their food, so I did the same for my website.


My experience with WordPress was mixed. I liked that you can choose your theme, and the free ones looked as good as the paid ones. But after that, I was overwhelmed with all the options and menus. I didn't know how to add pages or make the links work, and it took some time. But after using it and getting some practice, it became super easy to customize. I also liked how easy it was to just drag and drop text or images to the pages.
